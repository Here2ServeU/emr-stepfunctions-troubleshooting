# EMR Cluster and Step Functions Troubleshooting Project

## Overview
This project shows how to improve the reliability of EMR jobs using:
- Bootstrap scripts to tune Spark memory
- AWS Step Functions for retry orchestration of EMR steps

## Components

### `scripts/bootstrap.sh`
Custom script to configure EMR nodes with Spark memory settings.

### `stepfunctions/state_machine_definition.json`
State Machine definition using Step Functions to submit an EMR step with retry logic.

## Deployment Steps
1. Launch EMR cluster with `bootstrap.sh` in the bootstrap actions.
2. Deploy Step Function with `state_machine_definition.json`.
3. Pass the `ClusterId` to start the job submission.

## Spark Config Tuning
- `spark.executor.memory=2g`
- `spark.driver.memory=1g`

These settings help avoid executor memory issues during large-scale ML feature engineering.

## Outcome
✅ 95% reduction in EMR step failures  
✅ Increased reliability and monitoring using Step Functions
